Retail Sales Analysis in PostgreSQL

Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a retail sales dataset using PostgreSQL. I have created and solved 10 analytical questions using SQL queries to gain insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and transactional patterns.

Dataset

The dataset contains details of retail transactions, including:

Transaction date and time

Customer ID

Product category

Product details

Gender of the customer

Transaction amount (total sales)

Analysis Questions and Solutions

Create shifts and count number of orders per shift:

Morning (<=12)

Afternoon (12 < hour <= 17)

Evening (>17)

Find number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.

Find top 5 customers based on highest total sales.

Calculate average sale for each month and identify best-selling month.

Find total number of transactions made by each gender.

Find transactions where total sales are greater than 1000 for each category, month, and year.

Analyze sales trends by year and category.

Identify categories with highest average sales per transaction.

Find number of returning customers (customers who purchased more than once).

Calculate total sales per customer by year.

Technologies Used

PostgreSQL

SQL

How to Run

Load your dataset into PostgreSQL.

Use provided SQL scripts (in queries.sql) to execute each analysis query.

Results

Each query provides insights such as shift-based sales distribution, customer purchasing behavior, gender-based transaction counts, and monthly sales trends.
